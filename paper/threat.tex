\section{Threat Model \& Assumptions}

Our threat model assumes that the central server operates with integrity, conducting the federated averaging process without malicious objectives. However, we recognize the risk that the central server could compromise the privacy of client logs if raw data is transmitted to it. We assume there is no collusion between the central and utility servers. The integrity of client-side data collection is presumed, along with the absence of malicious clients during the training phase to prevent model poisoning.

For individual clients, we anticipate the presence of covert attackers capable of disguising their malicious activities within benign data, thereby complicating the distinction between malicious and normal actions. Additionally, we account for the possibility that attackers may exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. We assume that the attackers' activities will leave discernible traces in the system's records. In line with previous works on data provenance such as ~\cite{nodoze2019, priotracker2018, mzx2016, bates2017transparent}, our model presupposes that the provenance collection system accurately captures comprehensive records of all system activities and modifications. Furthermore, we assert the continuous integrity of audit logs, assured by the use of tamper-resistant storage solutions ~\cite{paccagnella2020custos, hardlog}.
