\section{Threat Model \& Assumptions}

Our threat model assumes that the central server operates with integrity, conducting the federated averaging process without malicious objectives. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the possibility of the server exhibiting curiosity, potentially seeking to deduce characteristics of client training data from individual model weights. We assume that there is no collusion between the central and utility servers. The integrity of client-side data collections is assumed, alongside the absence of malicious clients during the training phase to prevent model poisoning.

On individual clients, we presume the presence of covert attackers who can disguise their malicious activities within benign data, complicating the distinction between malicious and normal actions. Additionally, we consider that the attackers can use zero-day exploits. We assume that the attacker leaves behind discernible traces of their activities in the system's records. Similar to prior works in data provenance such as~\cite{nodoze2019,priotracker2018,mzx2016,bates2017transparent}, our model assumes the provenance collection system accurately captures comprehensive records of all system activities and modifications. Furthermore, we assert the continuous integrity of audit logs assured by the use of tamper-resistant storage solutions~\cite{paccagnella2020custos,hardlog}.
