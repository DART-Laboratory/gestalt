1. System logs may contain private information. According to \cite{datadog}, audit logs can potentially include sensitive data like bank account numbers. \\

2. Traditional intrusion detection systems require substantial volumes of data for training, which is typically not available on a single host machine. As a result, data must be aggregated from multiple hosts, potentially compromising privacy. Training on data from a single host can also result in suboptimal performance. \\

3. Sensitive organizations, such as banks or hospitals, often handle relatively smaller but highly confidential datasets. Conventional intrusion detectors may prove ineffective in such specialized domains. \\

4. The existing design of intrusion detection systems impedes the integration of federated learning techniques. \\
