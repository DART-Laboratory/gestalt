In this section, we will discuss existing systems related to the domain of provenance-based intrusion detection.

\PP{Machine Learning based PIDS} Many existing systems leverage machine learning techniques for threat detection. ProvDetector~\cite{provdetector2020} utilizes the Doc2Vec~\cite{le2014distributed} model to encode attack paths in provenance graphs into embeddings for outlier detection. Attack2Vec~\cite{shen2019attack2vec} employs a temporally aware word-to-embedding encoding scheme to identify attack entities. In the realm of network anomaly detection, DeepAid~\cite{deepaid} utilizes deep neural networks to differentiate anomalous traffic. DISTDET~\cite{dong2023distdet}, a host intrusion detection system, detects advanced persistent threats using hierarchical system event trees. ProGrapher~\cite{yangprographer} generates provenance graph embeddings for anomalous graph identification by integrating Graph2Vec~\cite{narayanan2017graph2vec} and TextRCNN~\cite{lai2015recurrent} models. StreamSpot~\cite{streamspot}, another graph-level detector, constructs benign models using various graph features and detects anomalies through clustering algorithms. Furthermore, \unicorn~\cite{han2020unicorn} employs graph kernels for graph-level threat detection. Other IDS systems~\cite{aljawarneh2018anomaly, maseer2021benchmarking, gyanchandani2012taxonomy,atlas} also utilize diverse embedding generation techniques. Additionally, studies such as \cite{zolkipli2011approach, chakkaravarthy2019survey, isohara2011kernel} focus on malware detection. Techniques like DeepLog~\cite{deeplog2017} directly process logs using recurrent neural networks. SIGL~\cite{sigl} specifically targets the detection of malicious software installations, while Euler~\cite{king2022euler} employs both GNN and RNN models to detect lateral movements.


% \PP{Rules-based IDS} Approaches like Holmes~\cite{holmes2019}, Rapsheet~\cite{rapsheet2020}, and Poirot~\cite{poirot2019} in specification-based IDS rely on predefined rules applied to provenance graphs to spot abnormal activities. These methods are successful in minimizing false positives but fall short against novel attacks, necessitating regular updates to keep up with new threats. \Sys, however, offers a scalable and effective alternative, detecting new types of threats by harnessing the detailed semantic and contextual data in provenance graphs.
