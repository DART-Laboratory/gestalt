\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) play an essential role in enterprise security strategies to counteract Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs are notably stealthy and persistent, exemplified by the significant system disruptions seen in attacks such as Solar Winds~\cite{solarwinds} and NotPetya~\cite{notpetya}. The effectiveness of IDSes hinges on their ability to accurately detect these threats, maintain low false positive rates, and operate with minimal resource consumption, ensuring system performance is not compromised.

Many organizations outsource their security operations to different MSSPs. A study~\cite{msspsurvey}  of more than 5,000 IT professionals found that nearly three in every four companies are turning to MSSPs The MSSP integrates their security tools with the client's systems to collect audit logs. This often involves configuring the clientâ€™s systems to send audit logs to the MSSP's security operations center (SOC) for analysis. The MSSP uses advanced analytical tools and techniques, such as machine learning algorithms , to analyze the log data. The goal is to identify suspicious patterns or anomalies that may indicate a security threat or intrusion. When a potential threat or intrusion is detected, the MSSP alerts the client

If you find any numbers on how many comapnies use MSSP and outsource their security operations that would be great. If you find any realworld attack examples on MSSP where the data was leaked that would be great as well. }

Data Provenance techniques have been increasingly used in IDSes to detect system intrusions. By analyzing system (audit) logs and converting them into provenance graphs, these systems offer a comprehensive view of system execution. Provenance-based IDSes~\cite{streamspot,provdetector2020,wang2022threatrace,shadewatcher,yangprographer,han2020unicorn} have emerged as a potent solution, utilizing the rich context within audit logs to improve detection capabilities. Despite their promise, these systems face significant challenges in the complex landscape of enterprise security:

\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=*]
    \item[--] \textbf{Lack of Privacy Preservation:} Traditional provenance-based IDSes (PIDS)~\cite{flash2024,cheng2023kairos,wang2022threatrace} rely on a centralized infrastructure, necessitating client machines to transmit their log data to a central server. Flash~\cite{flash2024} and Kairos~\cite{cheng2023kairos} are some recent state-of-the-art PIDS that operate in a centralized manner, assuming the audit logs from different machines will be present in a centralized location where these systems are operational. This approach risks user privacy as audit logs encompass detailed records of system execution, including sensitive information and activity patterns.
    
    \item[--] \textbf{Excessive Network and Disk Overhead:} Audit logs from modern systems can accumulate to gigabytes per day, resulting in significant network costs for both users and organizations. Additionally, the need for extensive disk storage to house these logs adds complexity. Current PIDS models fail to address these challenges, undermining their practical applicability. Our analysis of Flash and Kairos, utilizing the \optc dataset as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:eval}, illustrates this point. For an organization similar to the one represented in the \optc dataset, with a comparable number of hosts, the total volume of logs transmitted daily would reach 1000 GB. This volume of data could lead to substantial network and storage expenses daily. Moreover, it poses a significant challenge for users with limited network bandwidth to upload this volume of data efficiently.
    %\wajih{Could you give specific numbers about network overhead and disk overhead that would be great.} \wajih{Again cite existing PIDS with names that would suffer from this issue.}
    
    \item[--] \textbf{Scalability Challenges:} The centralized approach used by current Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS) leads to scalability challenges as the number of hosts in an organization increases. This centralization acts as a bottleneck, impeding efficient intrusion detection on a larger scale. Our evaluations of Flash and Kairos reveal that these systems would encounter log congestion in organizations comparable to the size represented by the \optc dataset. As detailed in Section~\ref{sec:eval}, Flash would require 27.7 hours, and Kairos 56.6 hours, to process a single day's worth of logs from the \optc dataset. %\wajih{Again you need to add more details here about scalability issues. Having specific numbers for existing PIDS is important. Also cite those existing PIDS }
\end{itemize}

To address these challenges, we introduce \Sys, an innovative IDS that combines provenance graph representation learning with federated learning. This approach enables efficient, accurate detection of APT attacks in a decentralized manner, preserving user privacy. We have developed various novel techniques to overcome the inherent challenges of applying federated learning to PIDS, such as client data heterogeneity and imbalance. Specifically, we introduce a personalized \gnnshort framework tailored to the entity level and a dual-server architecture designed to safeguard user log privacy.
