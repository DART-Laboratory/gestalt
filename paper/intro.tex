\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) play an essential role in enterprise security strategies to counteract Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs are notably stealthy and persistent, exemplified by the significant system disruptions seen in attacks such as Solar Winds~\cite{solarwinds} and NotPetya~\cite{notpetya}. The effectiveness of IDSes hinges on their ability to accurately detect these threats, maintain low false positive rates, and operate with minimal resource consumption, ensuring system performance is not compromised.

%\wajih{Give the workflow of MSSP and cite that organizations outsource their security. If you find any numbers on how many comapnies use MSSP and outsource their security operations that would be great. If you find any realworld attack examples on MSSP where the data was leaked that would be great as well. }

Many organizations outsource their security operations to different MSSPs. A study~\cite{msspsurvey}  of more than 5,000 IT professionals found that nearly three in every four companies are turning to MSSPs The MSSP integrates their security tools with the client's systems to collect audit logs. This often involves configuring the clientâ€™s systems to send audit logs to the MSSP's security operations center (SOC) for analysis. 

The MSSP can use a range of techniques to analyze these audit logs for detecting theats. Data Provenance techniques have been increasingly used in IDSes to detect system intrusions. By analyzing system logs and converting them into provenance graphs, these systems offer a comprehensive view of system execution. Provenance-based IDSes~\cite{streamspot,provdetector2020,wang2022threatrace,shadewatcher,yangprographer,han2020unicorn} have emerged as a potent solution, utilizing the rich context within audit logs to improve detection capabilities.

Despite their promise, the current mode of operation of MSSP and the techniques employed for detecting intrusions face significant challenges in the complex landscape of enterprise security:

\begin{itemize} [leftmargin=*]
    \item[--] \textbf{C1: Lack of Privacy Preservation:} The current mode of operation of MSSPs and traditional provenance-based IDSes (PIDS)~\cite{flash2024,cheng2023kairos,wang2022threatrace} rely on a centralized infrastructure, necessitating client machines to transmit their log data to a central server. Flash~\cite{flash2024} and Kairos~\cite{cheng2023kairos} are some recent state-of-the-art PIDS that operate in a centralized manner, assuming the audit logs from different machines will be present in a centralized location where these systems are operational. This approach risks user privacy as audit logs encompass detailed records of system execution, including sensitive information and activity patterns. These privacy concerns have been underscored in a report by Datadog~\cite{datadog}, a prominent provider of system monitoring services.
    
    \item[--] \textbf{C2: Excessive Network and Disk Overhead:} Audit logs from modern systems can accumulate to gigabytes per day, resulting in significant network costs for both users and organizations. Additionally, the need for extensive disk storage to house these logs adds complexity. Current PIDS models fail to address these challenges, undermining their practical applicability. Our analysis of Flash and Kairos, utilizing the \optc dataset as detailed in Section~\ref{cost_metric}, illustrates this point. For an organization similar to the one represented in the \optc dataset, with a comparable number of hosts, the total volume of logs transmitted daily would reach 1000 GB. This volume of data could lead to substantial network and storage expenses daily. Moreover, it poses a significant challenge for users with limited network bandwidth to upload this volume of data efficiently.
    %\wajih{Could you give specific numbers about network overhead and disk overhead that would be great.} \wajih{Again cite existing PIDS with names that would suffer from this issue.}
    
    \item[--] \textbf{C3: Scalability Challenges:} The centralized approach used by current PIDS leads to scalability challenges as the number of hosts in an organization increases. This centralization acts as a bottleneck, impeding efficient intrusion detection on a larger scale. Our evaluations of Flash and Kairos reveal that these systems would encounter log congestion in organizations comparable to the size represented by the \optc dataset. As detailed in Section~\ref{sec:eval}, Flash would require 27.7 hours, and Kairos 56.6 hours, to process a single day's worth of logs from the \optc dataset. %\wajih{Again you need to add more details here about scalability issues. Having specific numbers for existing PIDS is important. Also cite those existing PIDS }
\end{itemize}

%\wajih{I added C1, C2, C3 with each challenge above. You need to refer to each of the challenge below and tell how you solve that challenge. Something like: "To address C1, we do blah blah"}

To tackle these challenges, we introduce \Sys, a novel PIDS that merges provenance graph representation learning with FL. This hybrid approach facilitates efficient and precise detection of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks in a decentralized fashion, ensuring the preservation of user privacy (C1). Since \Sys operates in a decentralized manner, the client local logs data do not need to be transmitted over the network and stored at a centralized storage (C2). In \Sys, each client uses its local compute power to run the \Sys anomaly detection module. Thus, our system is naturally scalable (C3) with the number of host machines added to the network.

%\wajih{I will describe FL and associated challenges after introducing your methodology because it is your idea. Just like we discussed in our last lab meeting.}

%\wajih{The transition of this paragraph is not great. You already talked about solving changes above and then you again talk about solving challenges below. }
Federated learning~\cite{mcmahan2017communication} is a promising solution to deal with the challenges outlined earlier. This is a machine learning approach that enables a model to be trained across multiple decentralized devices holding local data samples, without exchanging them. However, integrating FL into existing PIDS presents significant challenges. FL requires addressing key issues, such as managing data imbalance among clients and coping with heterogeneous and non-Independent and Identically Distributed data~\cite{zhao2018federated}. The current designs of these systems lack built-in mechanisms to tackle these problems. Furthermore, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:motivation}, the architectural foundations of these systems do not naturally accommodate the application of FL.

We have devised several techniques to navigate the challenges inherent in applying FL to PIDS. In particular, we present a personalized \gnnshort Learning framework that is customized at the system entity level to deal with heterogeneous and imbalanced clients, alongside a multi-server architecture designed explicitly to protect user log privacy.

%\wajih{Add one paragraph how you solve that above mentioned challenge. This will highlight the novelty of your system.}

%\wajih{make sure to say two or three lines about adversarial attacks and say that more details are present in the discussion section.}

%\wajih{Add one paragraph related to evaluation results.}

We have conducted extensive evaluations of our system's effectiveness using open-source datasets from DARPA, specifically E3~\cite{darpae3}, E5~\cite{darpae5}, and OptC~\cite{anjum2021analyzing}. These datasets encompass a broad spectrum of attack scenarios and system behaviors. Our findings indicate that \Sys achieves high detection performance, with an average precision of 96\% and recall of 97\%. Thus, our system performs comparably to state-of-the-art centralized systems like FLASH and Kairos. As detailed in section~\ref{cost_metric}, our system achieves a 170-fold reduction in communication and storage costs compared to FLASH and Kairos. Since our technique is decentralized, it will only take approximately 3 minutes to run inference on the complete \optc dataset, whereas FLASH and Kairos take many hours. However, employing FL exposes our system to certain types of adversarial attacks, such as model poisoning, inference attacks, and gradient attacks. We provide a comprehensive analysis of our system's resilience against these attacks in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
