\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \Sys, a privacy-preserving system for intrusion detection that leverages secure model harmonization and a personalized provenance graph learning framework to tackle data heterogeneity and performance challenges in federated learning for PIDS settings. Our evaluations on open-source datasets show that \Sys matches the performance of centrally trained PIDS while preserving user privacy and providing better scalability.
