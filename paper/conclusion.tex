\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \Sys, a privacy-preserving system for intrusion detection that leverages secure \wordvec model harmonization and a process entity categorization-based \gnnshort ensemble learning framework to tackle data heterogeneity and performance challenges in federated learning for \pids settings. Our evaluations on open-source datasets show that \Sys matches the performance of centrally trained \pids while preserving user privacy and providing better scalability. Moreover, we also conduct experiments to evaluate the robustness of our system to various types of adversarial attacks.
