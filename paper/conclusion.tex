\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce \Sys, a novel system designed for privacy-preserving system intrusion detection. \Sys incorporates advanced techniques for model harmonization to address the non-iid data challenge effectively. It employs federated learning to provide a distributed and scalable framework for detecting system threats. Our evaluations, conducted on open-source datasets, demonstrate that \Sys achieves performance comparable to centrally trained models, with the added benefit of ensuring the privacy of user logs.
