\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced \Sys, a privacy-preserving intrusion detection system that combines federated provenance graph learning with secure \wordvec harmonization and process entity categorization-based \gnnshort ensemble training. \Sys addresses data heterogeneity, preserves client privacy, reduces network overhead, and scales efficiently. Evaluations on open-source datasets show that \Sys matches centralized \pids in accuracy, scales better, and remains robust against adversarial attacks. \wajih{Clean up references.
