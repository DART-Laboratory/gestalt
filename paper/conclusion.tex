\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \Sys, a system designed for privacy-preserving system intrusion detection. \Sys utilizes advanced techniques such as secure model harmonization and a personalized graph learning framework to address challenges of data heterogeneity and performance issues associated with applying federated learning (FL) to intrusion detection. It employs FL to offer a decentralized and scalable architecture for detecting system threats. Our evaluations, conducted on open-source datasets, demonstrate that \Sys achieves performance comparable to that of centrally trained models while preserving the privacy of user logs and maintaining high scalability.
