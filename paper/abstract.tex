    Enterprises increasingly depend on a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) for protection against malicious threats. However, the common practice of centralized management of system logs, containing sensitive data, raises privacy concerns, especially with the involvement of Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). These third-party entities provide vital security management services, such as intrusion detection, to enterprises. Storing and analyzing these sensitive system logs in the cloud, as part of their services, inadvertently heightens the risk of data breaches. Moreover, the centralized mode of operation of these entities makes it challenging to design scalable HIDS.

    Addressing this, our project offers a novel approach that merges the strengths of Federated Learning (FL) and Provenance Graph Representation Learning. This integration aims to create a more scalable and privacy-centric HIDS. Data provenance transforms system logs into detailed provenance graphs, offering a better understanding of host activities. When combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and FL, it becomes a powerful technique for differentiating benign from malicious behaviors. In our system, the audit logs from user machines do not need to leave the system. We have designed a multi-server architecture and a robust encryption scheme to preserve the privacy of important user log attributes. To address the challenges of non-IID data distributions, heterogeneous, and imbalanced clients, we implement a sophisticated GNN learning framework personalized at the system entity level. We also present a detailed analysis of our system's resilience against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluation of our system on real-world datasets from DARPA demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art detection performance while being highly scalable and privacy-preserving.
