    Enterprises increasingly depend on a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) for protection against malicious threats. However, the common practice of centralized management of system logs, containing sensitive data, raises privacy concerns, especially with the involvement of Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). These third-party entities provide vital security management services, such as intrusion detection, to enterprises. Storing and analyzing these sensitive system logs in the cloud, as part of their services, inadvertently heightens the risk of data breaches.

Addressing this, our project offers a novel approach that merges the strengths of Federated Learning (FL) and {\it data provenance}. This integration aims to create a more accurate and privacy-centric HIDS. Data provenance transforms system logs into detailed provenance graphs, offering a better understanding of host activities. When combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), these graphs become powerful tools for differentiating benign from malicious behaviors. However, the merger of FL and provenance graphs might risk data leakage. To mitigate this, we plan to leverage Local Differential Privacy (LDP), which adds controlled noise, ensuring data remains private while still benefiting from its insights.
