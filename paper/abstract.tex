\begin{abstract}

    Enterprises increasingly depend on Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for protection against malicious threats. These IDSes use \logs logs to monitor system activities. However, the common practice of centralized management of logs, containing sensitive data like IP addresses and system activity records, raises privacy concerns, especially with the involvement of Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). These third-party entities provide vital security management services, such as intrusion detection, to enterprises. Storing and analyzing these sensitive \logs logs in the cloud, as part of their services, inadvertently heightens the risk of privacy leakage.

    Addressing these issues, our project combines Federated Learning (FL) and Provenance Graph Representation Learning to create a scalable, decentralized, and privacy-focused IDS. However, designing such a system presents challenges, including generalizing the model across diverse data distributions, ensuring fair learning amid imbalanced client datasets, and generating consistent semantic feature encodings in a distributed setting for model convergence.
    
    In our system, logs from user machines remain local, enhancing privacy. We employ a multi-server architecture for secure aggregation of semantic attributes. One server generates encryption keys for client-level log attributes, while another performs computations on the encrypted data. To tackle the challenges of non-IID data distributions and imbalanced clients, we use a sophisticated ensemble framework of Graph Neural Networks, with each submodel specializing in unique system activity patterns. Extensive evaluations on DARPA datasets show that our system achieves state-of-the-art detection performance, comparable to centralized IDS, while being highly scalable and privacy preserving.

% Data provenance transforms \logs logs into detailed provenance graphs, offering a better understanding of host activities. When combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and FL, it becomes a powerful technique for differentiating benign from malicious behaviors.

% We have designed a multi-server architecture and a robust encryption scheme to preserve the privacy of important user log attributes. To address the challenges of non-IID data distributions, heterogeneous, and imbalanced clients, we implement a sophisticated GNN learning framework personalized at the system entity level. We also present a detailed analysis of our system's resilience against adversarial attacks. Extensive evaluation of our system on real-world datasets from DARPA demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art detection performance while being highly scalable and privacy-preserving.
