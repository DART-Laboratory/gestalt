\subsection{Problem Formulation \& Overview}

Let \( C = \{Client_1, Client_2, \ldots, Client_k\} \) denote the set of client machines, where each machine \( Client_i \), for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, k \), locally maintains its \logs to preserve privacy, ensuring that raw logs do not leave the machine. Our objective is to detect anomalous nodes within the client's provenance graphs, \( \{G_{c_1}, G_{c_2}, \ldots, G_{c_P}\} \), generated from these logs. To this end, we propose training a set of global \gnnshort models to model the benign behavior exhibited across all client logs without centralizing the log data.

Additionally, we aim to develop a global semantic encoder, \( \mathcal{E}_{\text{semantic}} \), capable of converting contextual attributes into vector space, thereby generating feature vectors for training our GNN models. Using these global \gnnshort models, we aim to identify anomalous nodes in provenance graphs constructed from \logs during runtime. These anomalies could be potential threats as their system activity significantly differs from benign patterns.

% \subsection{Overview}
\Sys comprises five key modules, starting with the \textit{Provenance Graph Constructor} module on each client machine, which transforms \logs into a provenance graph. While our approach to constructing provenance graphs builds on established methods~\cite{inam2023sok,nodoze2019,mpi+ma,loggc,lpm2015,hossain2017sleuth}, detailed information is provided in Appendix~\ref{sub:provconstruct}. The \textit{Semantic Featurization \& Harmonization} module (Section~\ref{semanfeat}) trains \wordvec models to encode semantic attributes and consolidates individual client models into a cohesive global model using a trusted utility server and encryption techniques. The \textit{Process Entity Categorization Module} (Section~\ref{sys:catg}) standardizes system entities across clients, ensuring uniformity in \gnnshort model training. The \textit{Federated Provenance Graph Learning Module} (Section~\ref{sys:fpgl}) then trains \gnnshort models on each client machine using harmonized semantic features, with the models aggregated on a central server through federated averaging. Finally, the \textit{Anomaly Detection Module} (Section~\ref{sys:anomaly_detection}) applies the unified global models for anomaly detection on each client machine. Figure \ref{fig:arch} illustrates the comprehensive architecture of \Sys, with further details in subsequent sections.

\subsection{Semantic Featurization \& Harmonization}
\label{semanfeat}

This module processes the provenance graph generated from system logs by transforming node attributes into feature vectors for the graph learning phase. Existing systems, such as \flash~\cite{flash2024}, have demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing semantic attributes of nodes to enhance detection performance. System logs are rich in attributes related to various entities, including process names and file paths. These attributes must first be converted into vector space to serve as node features for our GNN model. For this encoding, we employ the Word2Vec semantic encoder. The Word2Vec model processes different attributes for each type of node: for process nodes, it considers the process name and command line arguments; for file nodes, the file path; for socket nodes, the network IP address and port; and for module nodes, the module name. We transform the subgraph for each node into a document by combining its semantic attributes with the types of causal events, such as system calls, involving its neighbors. These documents are then transformed into fixed-length vectors using a Word2Vec model trained on non-malicious system logs. This approach effectively captures the semantic relationships between terms, producing dense embeddings that enhance the subsequent learning of graph representations.

Each client independently trains a Word2Vec model using their local logs for feature encoding. However, before these models can be utilized to encode text attributes effectively, it is essential to contextually merge individual client \wordvec models into a unified model \( Word2vec_{Global} \) for use across all clients. This unification is crucial; without it, each client would produce a different encoding, \(v_a^i\), for identical inputs, where \(i\) denotes the client. The variability in feature vectors, \(\{v_a^1, v_a^2, \ldots, v_a^N\}\), for the same attribute \(a\) across \(N\) clients, would compromise the consistency of client-based \gnnshort models. To ensure uniformity, the feature vectors for overlapping attributes must be averaged across clients. Such averaging ensures consistency in the feature representation, enhancing the effectiveness of the downstream federated averaging technique by maintaining uniformity in the input space for the \gnnshort models across all clients.

Our experiments with the \optc dataset revealed that, on average, different hosts can have up to 75\% overlap in process names, 41\% in files, and 60\% in network flows. This finding aligns with related work \cite{flash2024}, which shows that many system-level processes and files are common across different systems. In a centralized \pids, these attributes are learned by a single semantic encoder, mapping them to the same embedding space. In contrast, a federated setting, where each client trains its own encoder, can introduce model bias into the token embeddings, complicating the convergence for downstream GNN models using these vectors. To address this, it is essential to harmonize overlapping tokens to provide the model with a unified understanding of the semantic information present in system logs. Our system harmonizes only the tokens that overlap in the word2vec models across clients. Tokens that do not overlap are not averaged and remain unchanged. While clients share common activities due to standard system-level routines, some variations and patterns are unique to each client. Non-overlapping tokens preserve these unique patterns; however, they contribute to additional heterogeneity, which cannot be eliminated through harmonization. If these unique patterns are not accurately learned, they can lead to high false alarm rates. To capture these distinct local variations between clients, we have developed a novel ensemble GNN learning framework, detailed in Section \ref{sys:fpgl}, where each submodel specializes in distinct system patterns across clients, enhancing model precision as shown in Section \ref{sec:eval}.

The \wordvec model functions as a key-value store, with vocabulary tokens as keys, \(k\), and their corresponding vector representations as values, \(v_k\). To combine these models, we calculate the average vector of overlapping tokens from all client machines, creating a central model. The mathematical representation for averaging vectors of a token \(k\) across \(N\) clients is given by \(\bar{v}_k = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} v_{k,i}\) where \(\bar{v}_k\) is the averaged vector for token \(k\), and \(v_{k,i}\) is the vector representation of token \(k\) from the \(i\)-th client model.

However, transferring tokens -- containing sensitive data like process names, file names, and IP addresses -- to a central server could breach user privacy. To mitigate this, we employ a trusted utility server. Initially, the central server uses Fernet symmetric key encryption~\cite{ismail2020fernet,bokhari2016review} to generate an encryption key, which is distributed to clients. Clients then encrypt their \texttt{Word2vec} model tokens using the encryption key: \( E(v_{k}) = v_{k}^{'} \) and send them to the utility server. This server merges the encrypted models and dispatches the unified semantic vectors back to the respective clients, who decrypt them back: \( D(v_{k}^{'}) = v_{k} \). We present experimental studies in Section \ref{sec:encrypt} that compare the efficiency of Fernet encryption with other methods.

This procedure ensures that neither the central server nor the utility server can access the actual token information, assuming no collusion between the two servers. The process is explained in detail in Algorithm~\ref{alg:secure_integration_averaging_word2vec}.

\subsection{Process Entity Categorization}
\label{sys:catg}

Our experimental results, presented in Table~\ref{categorized_gnn}, indicate that a single global \gnnshort model is not able to achieve good detection performance in an FL setting due to the diverse and heterogeneous distributions of clients' data. The disparity in data distributions among various clients leads to a significant challenge in effectively training a unified model that can generalize well across all clients. This diversity often results in poor model performance, as the global model struggles to capture the unique characteristics and patterns inherent in the data of individual clients.

To address this limitation, we developed a comprehensive framework that categorizes process entities across different clients into distinct groups. This framework assigns process entities to specific categories, with each category being modeled by a dedicated submodel. This structured categorization enhances each submodel's ability to capture the unique distribution and intricate patterns of its assigned category, thereby improving overall detection performance.

The framework employs a central utility server that plays a pivotal role in the categorization process. Clients transmit lists of encrypted process names to the utility server to ensure privacy. The server aggregates these lists and randomly divides them into \(k\) global categories, where \(k\) is a predefined hyperparameter. We conducted experiments to explore the impact of \(k\) on detection accuracy and FL training cost, as detailed in Appendix \ref{app:ablation}.

After receiving the categorized lists from the server, clients organize their processes into \(k\) bins based on the assigned categories. This ensures that each bin contains similar processes across different clients. The processes within each bin are then used to generate provenance subgraphs, capturing their interactions with other system objects. The neighborhood hop length of the subgraphs is set equal to the number of graph convolution layers used in the \gnnshort. This ensures that the \gnnshort has complete neighborhood information of a given node for information aggregation and no interconnections are lost due to the categorization process. In our experiments, we set the hop length to two, which has been shown by prior works~\cite{wang2022threatrace,flash2024} to offer optimal efficiency and detection accuracy. These subgraphs serve as training data for an ensemble of \gnnshort models. Each submodel in the ensemble is trained on the subgraphs corresponding to its designated category and participates in federated averaging.

It is crucial to recognize that although the entities are split randomly, this process yields bins that are globally standardized across all clients. The original order in which entities are split at the utility server becomes irrelevant as long as the bins maintain global standardization. Each client aligns its local system entities with the global bins' indices, resulting in a distribution of system entities in each bin that is closely similar across clients. This uniformity enables each GNN model trained for a specific bin to focus on similar distributions, effectively addressing the heterogeneity issue.

This approach ensures a balanced and uniform segmentation of data across clients, maintaining consistency in the training datasets for each \gnnshort model before federated averaging. By dividing the overall task into sub-tasks (sub-models) and assigning them to different subsets of processes, the influence of clients with large datasets is diversified across multiple models. This prevents any single client from disproportionately influencing the outcome of the federated learning system. Each sub-model specializes in a different aspect of the data, capturing unique patterns and distributions. This specialization leads to more even contributions across the ensemble, enhancing the robustness and performance of the overall system.

\subsection{\fpgl}
\label{sys:fpgl}

We developed a federated provenance graph learning technique rather than applying FL directly on system logs data because APTs often consist of multiple, causally linked attack steps involving various system entities. These interactions are effectively modeled using provenance graphs, which help uncover attack paths by connecting related system objects. Graph representation learning (GRL) is well-suited for this scenario, enabling better detection performance compared to approaches that analyze system events in isolation. Consequently, existing \pids~\cite{flash2024,cheng2023kairos,jia2023magic} increasingly leverage GRL-based models to outperform techniques relying solely on individual system events~\cite{deeplog2017,liu2019log2vec,xia2019loggan}. We integrate GRL with federated learning to achieve comparable detection performance in a decentralized, privacy-preserving manner.

Our approach includes a central server responsible for initializing the global \gnnshort models denoted by \(\{GNN_1, GNN_2, \ldots, GNN_k\}\) with random weights, which are then sent to all clients. These clients use their local process subgraphs and semantic feature vectors to train the \gnnshort models in an unsupervised way, following a training method similar to \flash. The \gnnshort model's objective is to classify each node entity into its corresponding type. The server then applies the federated averaging algorithm to merge the \gnnshort models into a set of global models (\(GNN_{Globals}\)). These models are then merged according to the process entity categories on which they were trained. This ensures that models with similar distributions are combined together to address the data heterogeneity problem. Specifically, for each submodel, the server aggregates parameters from \(N\) client models to update the global model as follows:

\begin{equation}
\bar{w} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N}w_k
\end{equation}

where \(\bar{w}\) is the aggregated global model parameter, \(N\) is the number of client models and \(w_k\) is the parameter from the \(k\)-th client model.

The federated averaging process is repeated for a set number of rounds \(R\), and concludes when there is no further reduction in training loss. Algorithm~\ref{alg:federated_learning} shows the training and aggregation process of \gnnshort for a given process category and one round of FL.

\subsection{GNN-based Anomaly Detection}
\label{sys:anomaly_detection}

\Sys employs a standard node level detection methodology focusing on identifying irregular nodes through the comparison of their expected and observed types. This approach is grounded in a detailed analysis of both the surrounding structures and inherent properties of the nodes, to define normal pattern baselines for various node types. Typically, entities with malicious intentions display neighborhood structures and characteristics deviating from these established norms. In operational phases, the detection of anomalies that diverge from the pre-established node distribution patterns often results in their misclassification. The emergence of nodes misclassified in the system's output is indicative of potential security issues.

\Sys performs threat detection in a decentralized manner on client's provenance graphs (\( \{G_{c_1}, G_{c_2}, \ldots, G_{c_P}\} \)) in an organization. For a given provenance graph on a client machine containing nodes \(V\) and edges \(E\), \Sys uses the global \(\{GNN_1, GNN_2, \ldots, GNN_k\}\) \gnnshort models trained using federated learning. Each submodel performs inference on client's full provenance graph, utilizing the nodes' features \(X_v\) and the graph's adjacency matrix \(A\) to predict each node \(v\)'s label \(y_v^i\). A node \(v\) is identified as an anomaly if it is misclassified by all submodels, indicating that none of the submodels recognize the neighborhood structure or features displayed by this node. 

To regulate the frequency of alerts, we define a threshold \(T\) similar to \flash. This parameter sets a threshold on the likelihood of a classification being considered valid, with a higher value of \(T\) implying stronger confidence and increasing the probability of identifying anomalies.
