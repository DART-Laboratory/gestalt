\section{\Sys Design}
\label{sec:methodology}

\Sys, illustrated in Figure \ref{arch}, is composed of five key modules: a provenance graph constructor, a Federated Averaging server, a utility server, and client machines. At a high-level, \Sys generates provenance graphs from system logs, uses semantic attributes to create feature vectors for nodes, and applies \gnnshort for context-aware encoding. These embeddings are stored in a database and later used by a lightweight classifier during threat detection.
