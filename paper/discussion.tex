\PP{Adversarial Attacks} \Sys relies on the assumption that Utility server is trusted and does not collude with the recommendation server. Second, \Sys may be brittle to attackers with a large number of malicious clients. These clients can poison the global model by contributing noisy model weights.

\PP{False positives} While \Sys generally has a low rate of false positives, there are certain conditions that may cause them, particularly when benign activities go unnoticed. This issue is typical in anomaly-based detection systems. To mitigate this, periodic training of the model and tweaking the threshold for alerts can be beneficial.
